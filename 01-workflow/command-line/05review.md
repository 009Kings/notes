##Getting Help
For any command we discuss here, the command `man`, short for **manual**, will give a (hopefully) detailed explanation of that command.  Sometimes that explanation will be too detailed for you.  When you get lost in a man page and you want to understand it, start again from the beginning of of the **man page** and keep repeating.  Hopefully you will get further into the page each time you read it.

Many advanced commands also accept the --help option, but not all, but if you get stuck it can be worth a try. Most of the commands covered in this simple overview do not support this feature

    $ git --help

    usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c name=value]
             [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
             [-p|--paginate|--no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
             [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
             <command> [<args>]

**Note:** In documentation we often see a `#` or `$` or `~` prefix before code examples, these characters are used to indicate that the example is a something which is executed in the terminal (as opposed to being a code sample) and usually these are not supposed to be entered when you execute a command.
