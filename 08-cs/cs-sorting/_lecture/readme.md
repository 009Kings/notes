# Sorting Algorithms

This week, we've gone over the following sorts:

* Bucket sort
* Bubble sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort

### Here's some more.

## Why we have different sorts

Find out which sort is the fastest for each type of data.

## Other sorting topics

### Stability

What's the difference between stable and unstable sorts? Why would we want a stable sort?

### Types of sorts

**NOTE:** These are not exclusive definitions (for example, a comparison sort can also be an adaptive sort)

#### Comparison Sorts

Bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort have all been examples of comparison sorts. Positions in a data structure are changed based on comparing values.

#### Distribution Sorts

Bucket sort is an example of a distribution sort, where values are grouped based on certain attributes.

#### Hybrid Sorts

Since sorts like insertion sort are faster for smaller datasets, some recursive sort algorithms can be implemented as hybrid sorts, utilizing sorts like insertion sort on smaller datasets.
