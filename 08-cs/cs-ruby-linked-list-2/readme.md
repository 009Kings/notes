#Challenge: Linked list problems

Use the included Ruby file to implement the following methods.

##Find center

Finding the center element of a linked list is a classic interview problem. First just try to produce code that can get the right answer (regardless of efficiency). Then, try to get it done in O(n) time. You can assume that the list will be odd in length.

##Bonus - Reverse

If you manage to finish the find center method before we run out of time try another classic problem, reversing a linked list.

This should be completed in O(n) time and needs to be done in place (shouldn't use `insert_front` or `insert_end`).
