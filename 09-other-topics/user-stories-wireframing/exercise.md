# Wireframing Exercise: Build a Start-Up

## Concept Design

In groups, come up with an idea for a startup or business.

## Personas

Personas are hypothetical people who fit the target demographic for your product or service. Come up with at least two different types of people who might use your product.

> For example: Meet Becky, a 34 year old stay-at-home parent who has a special needs child. 

## User Stories

Create one or two user stories for each persona that you created that apply to the functionality for your startup/business, following what we learned in class.

Remember!! A user story takes the format: "As a _________ I want _________ so I can _________."

> For example: As a *stay-at-home mother of a special needs child*, I want *a diaper delivery service* so that I can *get diapers when I'm too busy with childcare to leave the house*.

## Wireframing

In groups of three or four, make a wireframe for a startup or business's home page using what we learned in class.

You can use an online tool *or* write your design on the whiteboards. Be prepared to present your idea to the class!
