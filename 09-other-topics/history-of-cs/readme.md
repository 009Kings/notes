# A Brief History of Computer Science

You may have never heard the names Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, or Alan Turing, but you wouldn't be programming today if it weren't for the foundational work they did in computer science. Today we'll discuss early computing, development of transistors, and up to the beginnings of the internet.

### Before we start...

Let's define a few words so we're all on the same page about what they mean

| Word | Definition in this Context |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mechanical | relating to physical forces or motion; physical. |
| Analogue | relating to or using signals or information represented by a continuously variable physical quantity such as spatial position or voltage. |
| Compute | To calculate or evaluate |
| Turing-Complete | Computationally universal - can model/solve any problem |

### What is a computer?

The word `computer` originally referred to the *person* who was doing the computing. More specifically to frame the history of computing, what we'll start out discussing is the history of machine-assisted human computation.

## Antiquity

### The Abacus

Yes, the first computing tool was an abacus - an early, manual calculator. To the best of anyone's knowledge, it was invented by the ancient Sumerians between 2700 and 2300 BC.

Notice an abacus, like other early computing devices were mechanical (meaning dictated by physical forces), not electrical. The ideas of computing and algorithms are rooted in mathematics.

### The Antikythera Mechanism

The Antikythera Mechanism is thought to be the first **analog computer**, and was developed in ancient Greece around the first or second century BC. It is so named because it was discovered in a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in 1901. 

Antikythera is northwest of Crete. Here is a map of the area:

It was used for various astronomical calculations such as predicting eclipses and irregularities in the moon's orbit, and for tracking all then-known heavenly bodies. The importance and sophistication of this artifact was overlooked until 2006 because it was originally thought to be far too advanced for the time period. In fact, it precedes any other known clockwork mechanisms of similar complexity by more than a milennia. 

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism), "The quality and complexity of the mechanism's manufacture suggests that it has undiscovered predecessors made during the Hellenistic period". The Hellenistic period is the time period between the death of Alexander the Great and the emergence of the Roman Empire.

### Other Early Advancements

Roughly contemporary with the Antikythera mechanism, an Indian mathematician named [Pingala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingala), is credited with the first use of a binary number system.

## Middle Ages

During this time period, advancements in mathematics and further understanding of things like binary numbers and floating point numbers set the stage for future developments. Mechanical clocks and geared mechanisms became more advanced. The first true computers were based on clocks and calculators.

## Early and Mid-Modern Era

### Pascal's Calculators

In 1642, while still a teenager helping his father with tax collection duties in France, [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal) invented a mechanical calculator. These were later known as Pascal's Calculators or Pascalines. While other attempts had been made, this was the first fully functional and properly working version.

### Babbage's Analytical Engine

Charles Babbage designed a new kinds of mechanical calculator - his [analytical engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine). This went beyond his original design of a differential engine (basically an advanced mathematical calculator), and provided the first idea of a programmable computer. It's the first design for a computer that could be considered [Turing-Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) in the modern sense of how we think of computers, although when Babbage was designing his analytical engine, Alan Turing was not even born yet.

Babbage's analytical engine's design was ground-breaking. No one, up until that point had designed any machines that were this general in usage. The analytical engine was not built in Babbage's lifetime, but later models suggest his machine would have worked. 

#### Details

Babbage's analytical engine took input of 'formulae' and 'data' - which were to be fed into the machine via punchcards - similar to mechanical looms of that time period. There was to be a 'store' which had room for 1000 40-digit numbers (or about 16kB). The internal operations supported included basic mathematical operators, comparison operators, and square roots. Loops and conditionals were also possible. The language used would be similar to modern-day assembly languages.

[Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) corresponded with Babbage during his development of the analytical engine, and developed a working relationship and friendship with him. She wrote an algorithm that would allow the engine to compute [Bernoulli numbers](http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/Miscellaneous/bernoulli.html) (a recurring theme in number theory), and is thus credited as the first programmer, even though no programming languages had been invented yet. She wrote the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine.

### US Census

In the United States, census data is collected every ten years. In 1880, the US Census count took seven years. Population trends indicated that the 1890 census might take over 10 years, so they looked for another solution by holding a contest to find a better way to do it. A census department employee named Herman Hollerith won the contest. He would later go on to found the  Tabulating Machine Company, which later to became IBM. His solution used punchcards to input the data and mechanical relays to increment the count.

## Modern Era

### Alan Turing

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/briezh/image/upload/v1539104015/Alan_Turing_Aged_16_qi8uza.jpg)

Alan Turing is considered the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He formalized the meanings of words `algorithm` and `computation`. He worked at Cambridge University and performed [critical code breaking work for the British during World War 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma).

Turing also developed the idea of a Turing machine. A Turing machine, simply stated, is a machine that can model any kind of algorithm with an answer. For the sake of argument, we usually don't consider any memory constraints. For a more detailed explanation in layman's terms, see [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4umot5/eli5_what_does_turing_complete_mean/).

### World War 2

While discussing the advent of the modern computer, it's impossible not to discuss in some part the second world war. Many advancements on both ally and axis sides were made in the war effort. While people like Turing were working on decryption for the allied forces, people like [Konrad Zuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse) were working in Germany. Zuse's work was ignored or understated for a long time due to the fact that he worked for the Nazis. For his part, he never became a member of the Nazi party but also never expressed any qualms about working for them. An exerpt from Wikipedia says the following:

**"While Zuse never became a member of the Nazi Party, he is not known to have expressed any doubts or qualms about working for the Nazi war effort. Much later, he suggested that in modern times, the best scientists and engineers usually have to choose between either doing their work for more or less questionable business and military interests in a Faustian bargain, or not pursuing their line of work at all."**

Make of that what you will - this is a history lesson, and not meant to put a value judgment on a person's choices, this is merely meant to summarize advancements in the field of computing.  In fact, Zuse's [Z3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)) computer is considered the first modern, Turing-complete, fully-programmable computer, and the programming language he used, [Plankalkül](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankalk%C3%BCl) was the first high-level programming language. 


#### Plankalkül Features/Limitations

* Only local variables
* No recursion
* Only call by value
* Composite types: arrays and tuples
* Conditionals (if, else)
* For and while loops
* Only primitive data type is a single bit

### ENIAC and EDVAC 

Meanwhile in the United States, the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was created by the US Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory.

[John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) was a mathematician working on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos. When he heard about the ENIAC, Los Alamos became heavily involved with it as well, and ran it's first program on the ENIAC, which was a test of the feasibility of a thermonuclear weapon. The I/O for this test used 1 million punchcards.

John von Neumann subsequently worked on the [EDVAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDVAC) (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer). Unlike the ENIAC, it used a binary number system rather than a decimal system. When describing this computer, von Neumann described the basic architecture of the modern computer.

### Compilers and High-Level Programming Languages

With the development of the first Turing-complete computers, soon followed the development of programming languages to use on them. Some notable developments include:

* [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) (1957) - First to use a compiler
* [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) (1958) - First procedural programming language
* ALGOL (1958)

#### FORTRAN

[FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran), first released in 1957, stands for 'FORmula TRANslation'. It is considered a high-level language and was the first language to use a compiler to translate high-level code down into machine code. Here is a simple program written in FORTRAN:

```FORTRAN
C AREA OF A TRIANGLE WITH A STANDARD SQUARE ROOT FUNCTION
C INPUT - TAPE READER UNIT 5, INTEGER INPUT
C OUTPUT - LINE PRINTER UNIT 6, REAL OUTPUT
C INPUT ERROR DISPLAY ERROR OUTPUT CODE 1 IN JOB CONTROL LISTING
      READ INPUT TAPE 5, 501, IA, IB, IC
  501 FORMAT (3I5)
C IA, IB, AND IC MAY NOT BE NEGATIVE OR ZERO
C FURTHERMORE, THE SUM OF TWO SIDES OF A TRIANGLE
C MUST BE GREATER THAN THE THIRD SIDE, SO WE CHECK FOR THAT, TOO
      IF (IA) 777, 777, 701
  701 IF (IB) 777, 777, 702
  702 IF (IC) 777, 777, 703
  703 IF (IA+IB-IC) 777, 777, 704
  704 IF (IA+IC-IB) 777, 777, 705
  705 IF (IB+IC-IA) 777, 777, 799
  777 STOP 1
C USING HERON'S FORMULA WE CALCULATE THE
C AREA OF THE TRIANGLE
  799 S = FLOATF (IA + IB + IC) / 2.0
      AREA = SQRTF( S * (S - FLOATF(IA)) * (S - FLOATF(IB)) *
     +     (S - FLOATF(IC)))
      WRITE OUTPUT TAPE 6, 601, IA, IB, IC, AREA
  601 FORMAT (4H A= ,I5,5H  B= ,I5,5H  C= ,I5,8H  AREA= ,F10.2,
     +        13H SQUARE UNITS)
      STOP
      END
```

#### LISP

**"Lisp has jokingly been called "the most intelligent way to misuse a computer". I think that description is a great compliment because it transmits the full flavor of liberation: it has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking previously impossible thoughts."** 

- [Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra)

The name [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) is derived from 'LISt Processor', and one of the major types used in LISP are linked lists. LISP is based on Lambda calculus and quickly became a favorite language for artificial intelligence research at that time. It is known for its clean syntax and elegant structure. A person who writes a LISP program will spend more time thinking than typing.

LISP is the 2nd oldest programming language in use today. The most common LISP dialects in use today are [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) and Common LISP. It's the first language to use [read-eval-print-loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) or an interactive shell. 

LISP pioneered many of the structures and concepts in modern-day computer science such as tree-based data structures, dynamic typing, recursion, higher-order functions, and others. The languages you know and love today would not exist without these concepts.


Here is an [example function](https://www.cs.trinity.edu/~jhowland/ccsc97/ccsc97/node10.html) definition in Scheme:

```Scheme
(define square
    (lambda (x)
      (* x x)))
```

Then, invoking the function in a REPL:

```Scheme
> (square 10)
100
```

Because it is so elegant, programmers have popularly referred to LISP (some more or less jokingly) as the language of God. Here is your relevant XKCD:
