# A Brief History of Computer Science

You may have never heard the names Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, or Alan Turing, but you wouldn't be programming today if it weren't for the foundational work they did in computer science. Today we'll discuss early computing, development of transistors, and up to the beginnings of the internet.

### Before we start...

Let's define a few words so we're all on the same page about what they mean

| Word | Definition in this Context |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mechanical | relating to physical forces or motion; physical. |
| Analogue | relating to or using signals or information represented by a continuously variable physical quantity such as spatial position or voltage. |
| Compute | To calculate or evaluate |

### What is a computer?

The word `computer` originally referred to the *person* who was doing the computing. More specifically to frame the history of computing, what we'll start out discussing is the history of machine-assisted human computation.

## Antiquity

### The Abacus

Yes, the first computing tool was an abacus. To the best of anyone's knowledge, it was invented by the ancient Sumerians between 2700 and 2300 BC.

Notice an abacus, like other early computing devices were mechanical (meaning dictated by physical forces), not electrical. The ideas of computing and algorithms are rooted in mathematics.

### The Antikythera Mechanism

The Antikythera Mechanism is thought to be the first Analog computer, and was developed in ancient Greece around the first century BC. It is so named because it was discovered in a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in 1901.

It was used for various astronomical calculations such as predicting eclipses and irregularities in the moon's orbit. The importance of this artifact was missed until the 1950's because it was originally thought to be far too advanced for the time period.
