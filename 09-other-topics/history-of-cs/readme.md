# A Brief History of Computer Science

You may have never heard the names Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, or Alan Turing, but you wouldn't be programming today if it weren't for the foundational work they did in computer science. Today we'll discuss early computing, development of transistors, and up to the beginnings of the internet.

### Before we start...

Let's define a few words so we're all on the same page about what they mean

| Word | Definition in this Context |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mechanical | relating to physical forces or motion; physical. |
| Analogue | relating to or using signals or information represented by a continuously variable physical quantity such as spatial position or voltage. |
| Compute | To calculate or evaluate |
| Turing-Complete | XXX |

### What is a computer?

The word `computer` originally referred to the *person* who was doing the computing. More specifically to frame the history of computing, what we'll start out discussing is the history of machine-assisted human computation.

## Antiquity

### The Abacus

Yes, the first computing tool was an abacus - an early, manual calculator. To the best of anyone's knowledge, it was invented by the ancient Sumerians between 2700 and 2300 BC.

Notice an abacus, like other early computing devices were mechanical (meaning dictated by physical forces), not electrical. The ideas of computing and algorithms are rooted in mathematics.

### The Antikythera Mechanism

The Antikythera Mechanism is thought to be the first **analog computer**, and was developed in ancient Greece around the first or second century BC. It is so named because it was discovered in a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in 1901. 

Antikythera is northwest of Crete. Here is a map of the area:

It was used for various astronomical calculations such as predicting eclipses and irregularities in the moon's orbit, and for tracking all then-known heavenly bodies. The importance and sophistication of this artifact was overlooked until the 1950s because it was originally thought to be far too advanced for the time period. In fact, it precedes any other known clockwork mechanisms of similar complexity by more than a milennia. 

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism), "The quality and complexity of the mechanism's manufacture suggests that it has undiscovered predecessors made during the Hellenistic period". The Hellenistic period is the time period between the death of Alexander the Great and the emergence of the Roman Empire.

### Other Early Advancements

Roughly contemporary with the Antikythera mechanism, an Indian mathematician named [Pingala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingala), is credited with the first use of a binary number system.

## Middle Ages

During this time period, advancements in mathematics and further understanding of things like binary numbers and floating point numbers set the stage for future developments. Mechanical clocks and geared mechanisms became more advanced. The first true computers were based on clocks and calculators.

## Early and Mid-Modern Era

### Pascal's Calculators

In 1642, while still a teenager helping his father with tax collection duties in France, [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal) invented a mechanical calculator. These were later known as Pascal's Calculators or Pascalines. While other attempts had been made, this was the first fully functional and properly working version.

### Babbage's Analytical Engine

Charles Babbage designed a new kinds of mechanical calculator - his [analytical engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine). This went beyond his original design of a differential engine (basically an advanced mathematical calculator), and provided the first idea of a programmable computer. It's the first design for a computer that could be considered [Turing-Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) in the modern sense of how we think of computers, although when Babbage was designing his analytical engine, Alan Turing was not even born yet.

Babbage's analytical engine's design was ground-breaking. No one, up until that point had designed any machines that were this general in usage. The analytical engine was not built in Babbage's lifetime, but later models suggest his machine would have worked. 

#### Details

Babbage's analytical engine took input of 'formulae' and 'data' - which were to be fed into the machine via punchcards - similar to mechanical looms of that time period. There was to be a 'store' which had room for 1000 40-digit numbers (or about 16kB). The internal operations supported included basic mathematical operators, comparison operators, and square roots. Loops and conditionals were also possible. The language used would be similar to modern-day assembly languages.

[Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) corresponded with Babbage during his development of the analytical engine, and developed a working relationship and friendship with him. She wrote an algorithm that would allow the engine to compute [Bernoulli numbers](http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/Miscellaneous/bernoulli.html) (a recurring theme in number theory), and is thus credited as the first programmer, even though no programming languages had been invented yet. She wrote the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine.

### US Census

In the United States, census data is collected every ten years. In 1880, the US Census count took seven years. Population trends indicated that the 1890 census might take over 10 years, so they looked for another solution by holding a contest.
