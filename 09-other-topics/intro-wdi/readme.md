#Intro to WDI

##Objectives

* Determine guiding principles for our class culture
* Identify the goals of the course
* List the core expectations of instructors and students
* Map out the topics and technologies of web development, and identify which we will and will not cover
* List the main "Dos" and "Don'ts" for the class and the space

## Growth Mindset

[The Power of Belief - Mindset and Success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN34FNbOKXc)

- This *may* be the most challenging thing you've ever done mentally â€“ the first time you've been bad at something in a long time.
- Failure and struggle are crucial aspects of this path. We don't succeed despite challenges -- we succeed because of challenges. [The Learning Myth: Why I'll Never Tell My Son He's Smart](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/blog/post/95208400815/the-learning-myth-why-ill-never-tell-my-son-hes)
  - Unfortunately, this can hurt. Just like exercise can make you sore and tired, so should learning. Try to enjoy the burn knowing it is making you better.
  - We as instructors anticipate that you will run into hardships. When you do, don't run for the hills! Buckle down and work through the problem. Embrace the fact that the hardship will make you a better coder. Endure the struggle to grow and develop your mind.
  - The Positive Change Cycle
  ![Positive Change Cycle](http://changingminds.org/images/change_positive.gif)
- Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence and being open to failure. It's about being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it. AND I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."

##What Will I Learn?

**Exercise:** Brainstorm and write down as many tech "buzzwords" as you can think of. We'll go over the ones that we'll cover during the course.

Specifically, we'll be going over these concepts and more:

* Version control (Git)
* Interacting with software (Command Line Interface)
* Front-end presentation (HTML/CSS)
* DOM Manipulation (jQuery)
* Databases (PostgreSQL and MongoDB)
* Programming languages (JavaScript and Ruby)
* Web application frameworks (Express and Rails)
* Web security measures (Authentication and input validation)
* Data abstraction (ORMs like Sequelize and ActiveRecord)
* Front-end application frameworks (AngularJS, ReactJS)
* Computer science topics (data structures, algorithms)
* Design patterns (MVC, singletons, modules)

###Why These Topics?

Note that there's tons of different languages and frameworks that we could learn that pertain to web development. We're going to cover languages and frameworks that satisfy all or most of these conditions:

* Popularity - more demand for a language/framework means more jobs
* Support - software with strong communities tend to have wide use
* Speed - in context of freelancing and/or entrepreneurship, it's beneficial to use software that speeds up the development process
* Conventional - learning topics that follow common paradigms will make it easier to pick up other languages/frameworks

But mainly, the job market will decide these topics. See [Indeed Job Trends](http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends)

  - 9:17-10:00:  Homework Review/Morning Exercise/Mini-lesson
  - 10:00-12:00: Lesson 1 (lecture and lab)
  - 12:00-1:00:  Lunch (1 hr, may be at 12:30 depending on the day)
  - 1:00-4:00:   Lesson 2 (lecture and lab)
  - 4:00-5:00:   Office hours and continued lab time
  - 5:00-?:      Homework time (led by TAs)

- Friday
  - 9:17-10:30:  Outcomes Programming
  - 10:30-12:00: Lesson 1 (lecture and lab)
  - 12:00-1:00:  Lunch (1 hr, may be at 12:30 depending on the day)
  - 1:00-4:00:   Lesson 2 (lecture and lab)
  - 4:00-5:00:   Office hours and continued lab time
  - 5:00-?:      Homework time (led by TAs)


#### Project Weeks (3, 6, 9, 12)

Instead of the usual lesson structure, project weeks will include the following:

- Mini-lessons
  - We will offer optional mini-lessons during project weeks, covering tools and techniques that are particularly relevant to the project at hand. Mini lessons will be held during project weeks 3, 6, and 9 in the mornings. They will generally run 1-2 hours.
- Work Time
  - Generally, you will be working on a project for the entire week, with your instructors, DIR, and TAs to support you.
- Outcomes
  - In most cases, the Outcomes schedule will also remain the same during project weeks

###Tools for Communication

We'll be using the following tools for communication:

- **Trello** - course schedule
- **Slack** - real-time/social communication, additional resources and materials
- **Github** - lecture notes and lab/homework/project materials, such as requirements, starter code, and solutions
- **Email** - formal communication, such as class disputes, recommendations, and other questions/concerns

### Asking for Help

- When working on assignments and projects, we request that you go through the following **channels**.
  - **Proper Channels to Ask for Help**
    - Look up the answer in the notes or using [other resources](http://www.google.com)
    - Ask a classmate
    - Ask your DIR/TAs/Instructors
  - **Question**: Why would we ask you to do this?
  - **Answer**: A couple reasons
    - Often, your instructional team will get the same question from 10 different people. By asking the internet or your classmates, we can answer more questions in the same amount of time.
    - To simulate the workplace. Part of becoming a great software developer is learning when to research/problem-solve and when to ask someone for help. Initially, we'll expect lots of questions, but by the end of the course, you'll have the ability to research most problems yourself, while still being able to consult the instructional team if you encounter a very challenging roadblock.

### Instructor Communication

- Instructors **may not** respond to code questions via Slack or in person after 5:00pm, even if we're in the office.
  - **Question**: Why would we do this?
  - **Answer**: Work/Life Balance.
- Feel free to send any messages to us and we'll reach out to you the next day. For immediate help on homework or projects, you may send messages to your fellow classmates or TAs.

### Feedback

####For You

Throughout the course, you'll receive feedback in a variety of ways.

- Quizzes (we don't grade them, but they're more of a self-check)
- 1:1 meetings with instructors (after projects)
- Homework feedback

We will also notify you, if necessary, when you are not on track to "graduate" from WDI. To be on track, **effort** our best indicator. We define **effort** as:

- Showing up to class, no more than 4 absences
- Making a true attempt on 80% of the homework
- Finishing projects

####For Us

Throughout the course, you'll have the opportunity to give the instructional team feedback in a variety of ways.

- Exit tickets
- Addressing concerns during 1:1 meetings
- Addressing concerns directly to your course producer

This feedback will be used in order to improve our curriculum, methods of instruction, and protocols for handling other issues.
