# Intro To jQuery

### Objectives

* Describe jQuery and its purpose as a JavaScript library
* Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using jQuery.
* Practice using jQuery selectors

#### What is jQuery?
jQuery is a free, open-source, 3rd-party library that is intended to make front-end development tasks --- particularly those involving DOM selection and manipulation --- easier, faster, and more fun.

#### But wait, what do we mean by 'library'?

**A `library`** is a collection of reusable functions that serve a particular purpose. The great thing about libraries is that we're using code that solves common problems, thus avoiding *reinvention of the wheel*.

#### Why use it?

* simplifies complex DOM manipulation
* concise, intuitive, readable syntax also
* solves many cross-browser compatibility issues for us
* fun and super helpful jQuery plugins
* well-maintained, issues resolved quickly
* designed for developers to implement complex functionality quickly and easily
* makes css changes and javascript animation very simple
