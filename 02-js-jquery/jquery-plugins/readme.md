## Objectives

* Experiment with different plugins and making custom jQuery plugins

## What is a Plugin?

Plugins are pieces of code that someone else has written to extende jQuery's functionality. The most common plugin is jQuery UI.

## How to implement
jQuery plugins require jQuery in order to work, so the script tag that pulls in the plugin must come **after** the one that pulls in jQuery.

## jQuery UI

jQueryUI provides an additional library of user interactions and elements not provided by jQuery. You can find the jQuery and jQueryUI CDN here: https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/

jQuery UI also provides elements with 'themes' or styling. In order to use these styled elements (dropdowns, accordions, etc.), be sure to include the appropriate jQuery UI CSS stylesheet in the head tag as well.
