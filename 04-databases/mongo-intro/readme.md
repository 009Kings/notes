#Intro to MongoDB

##Objectives

* Describe how Mongo databases came about & why they're useful
* Compare and contrast NoSQL with SQL
* Define what a document is in the context of MongoDB
* Explain the difference between embedded and referenced documents, and how we use each to model relationships in MongoDB
* Issue basic CRUD commands to a database from the Mongo Shell

###Administration Interface

In PostgreSQL, we used an administration interface (PG Commander) to easily interact with our database. There are also administration interfaces for MongoDB. Here is a handy link that lists a few:

For OSX users, we recommend [MongoHub](https://github.com/jeromelebel/MongoHub-Mac)
