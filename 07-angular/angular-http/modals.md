#Making More Requests with OMDB

We have a working OMDB app using `$http`! But let's make it more useful by creating a modal when each title is clicked.

[Angular UI Bootstrap Modals](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/modal)

* When a title is clicked, a modal should open that displays the movie's plot, actors, and other information
  * Hint: requires passing the **imdbID** to the modal and making another request with `$http`

**Remember** to run a HTTP server for the modals
