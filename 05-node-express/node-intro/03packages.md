# Node Package Manager

There are three types of Node modules:
1. Core Modules (like ```fs```)
2. Local Modules (that you create)
3. Third Party Modules

Core modules are great for gaining quick access to commonly-needed functionality in your program, and local modules allow you the flexibility to build out whatever tools you might possibly need, but third party modules, which fall somewhere in between, are perhaps the most exciting modules of them all!

### Node Packages

Because developers are awesome, there are hundreds of thousands of already-written modules out there, ready for use! Each of these modules are encapsulated in a ***Node Package*** and made available via ***Node Package Manger*** or ***NPM***, for short. A node package is a folder that contains one or more modules, a ```package.json``` file, and any meta-info needed to make the modules work correctionly and play well with your node program.

### NPM

NPM is the largest open-source software registry in the world. It includes a website, a registry of Node Packages, and a command line interface that allows us to easily incorporate packages into our programs.

The NPM CLI makes incorporating a node package into your program fairly easy, but you can refer to [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa4dc480Apo&list=PLQso55XhxkgBMeiYmFEHzz1axDUBjTLC6) if you ever get lost. It includes a whole series of videos that demonstrate the fundamentals of using NPM.
